SproutCore-Calendar is a calendar widget distributed as a SproutCore framework, ready to be included in a SproutCore application.

It is in its very early stages of development. Don't expect it to work well, to be fully featured or to be correctly tested.

The Calendar framework comes with a sample application to show how it can be integrated in a SproutCore application.
